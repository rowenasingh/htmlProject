    <h2>Just Got Back from Portugal!</h2>
    <h4>POSTED: <time datetime="2013-06-24">June 24, 2013</time></h4>
    <p>We visited beautiful Portugal in <time datetime="2013-06">June of 2013</time> and had a wonderful trip.</p>
    <p>Lisbon is a gorgeous city, full of plazas, cafes, museums, and nightlife. Not to mention the restaurants! Unfortunately, we didn't arrive until <time datetime="06-12">June 12,</time> thus missing the Portugal Day holiday celebration, which is every <time datetime="06-10">June 10.</time></p>
    <span>Our favorite part of the trip was enjoying the views of</span>
    <p class="lastpar">the city from Tram 28. We had heard from other travelers that the best time to ride the tram is in the early morning, from <time datetime="06:00">6:00am</time> to <time datetime="09:00">9:00am,</time> before the crowds are heavy. This turned out to be great advice.</p>
    <p class="lastpar">On our final day, we wanted to visit the beaches in Cascais, about 20 miles west of Lisbon, but our departing flight was at <time datetime="15:00">3:00pm,</time> so there just wasn't enough time. All the excuse we need to return for another visit in the future!</p>
    <p class="lastpar">Tired but happy, we arrived back in Chicago at <time datetime="2013-06-19T07:00:00-06:00">7:00am on June 19.</time></p>
